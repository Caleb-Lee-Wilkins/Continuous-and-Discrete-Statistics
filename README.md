# Continuous-and-Discrete-Statistics

This repository contains a notebook (in .ipynb form and .html for ease of reading) which contains a thorough, descriptive walkthrough of examples of both continuous and non-continuous distributions that often appear in statistical analysis. Further, this notebook shows preliminary methods of how to interpret these distributions in regards to probabilities.
